## Solar Power Usage Map Of Department Buildings at Hacettepe University


- This is a field project that will make our campus sustainable and smart under the title of Sustainable Cities and Communities.

## Project Overview

* The 11th target, "Sustainable Cities and Communities," was considered among the "17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)," which is one of the UN's goals. We looked at the sustainability issue of the Beytepe Campus of Hacettepe University. The location of the solar panels and how much of the faculties use the energy produced by the sun were investigated.

## Subject Of The Project

* The subject of the project is the investigation of Hacettepe University Beytepe Campus’s faculties in terms of solar energy production and use within the scope of 'Sustainable Cities and Communities'.

## Aim Of The Project

* The aim of this project is to see what level we are at in the production and use of solar energy as faculties of the Beytepe campus. 
 * In this context, the objectives of the project are:
    * To draw attention to the situations that are not sufficient, if any.
    * As a renewable, sustainable and clean energy source, the sun aims to reduce the use of fossil fuels.
    * It is aimed to reduce energy costs by meeting the energy need with the energy produced by solar panels.
    * To ensure the homogeneous distribution of the new panels to be added to the Beytepe campus.
    * It aims to make use of the map in homogeneous distribution of the energy provided by the added panels to the faculties.
    * The use of solar energy aims to protect the future of the world by using sustainable and renewable energy sources.

## Requirements
* The requirements of this project are as follows:
    * Providing the QGIS program to be used in the project, finding people who can actively use it, and obtaining the necessary data for the software.
    * Providing the data used throughout the project from open source and containing up-to-date information,
    * Sorting and coloring the panels according to the amount of energy provided by the use,
    * Determining the position and angle of solar panels according to the direction of the sun's rays,
    * Determining the locations of the panels in the campus,
    * Calculation of the distribution of the energy supplied from the panels to the area and its active use,
    * To be used as a reference in determining the number of panels that can provide solar energy to the entire campus in case the project is developed,
    * Providing the financial resources needed throughout the project, ensuring low cost in the formation of the project,
    * Reporting the project process, presenting the created maps,


## Necessary information for solar panel data

The solar panel data that we collected using google earth were processed. other than that, web browsing was done. Apart from what we have identified, there are solar panels in landscaping areas, illuminated traffic signs and some traffic lights [1]. Currently, the total capacity of the solar panels on the campuses is calculated as approximately 400000 kWh per day. In 2021, daily energy production of approximately 150000 kWh has been experienced practically [1].

## Maps
 ** Faculties are marked and scaled from green to red which means that green - fully solar power used, red - none solar power used. In addition, the collected solar energy panel data was added as a layer to the map in QGIS.
